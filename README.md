## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS Pre-Processor

### What I learned

I leanred how to use SASS this time. Creating modules can be really handy for keeping everything organized, but takes some time if you need to switch between files constantly.

This was also the first time I used Grid. It's quite handy for making some more complex responsive layouts. 

### Continued development

In the next projects I would like to use Grid. 

### Useful resources

- [gridbyexample](https://gridbyexample.com) - Good reference for all about Grid. 
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) - For finding errors in my code.
